# Student API Documentation

---

## üìç Introduction

This is an educational REST API for managing a simple database of students. It allows you to:

- Register new students.
- Query students by ID.
- Query students by career.
- Delete students.

Student data is persisted using a local JSON file (`students.json`) to simulate a database.

---

## üîç Base URL

```bash
http://localhost:5001/api/students
```

The server must be running on port `5001`.

---

## üîí Authentication

All requests must include an **API Key** in the Authorization header:

```text
Authorization: Bearer 12345ABCDEF
```

If the key is missing or incorrect, the server will respond with `401 Unauthorized`.

## üí° Notes

- All responses are in JSON format.
- If you modify the students (add/delete), changes are saved automatically to `students.json`.
- Restarting the server preserves the updated list thanks to JSON persistence.

## üíº Example Authorization Header

```text
Authorization: Bearer 12345ABCDEF
```

This must be included in every request.
